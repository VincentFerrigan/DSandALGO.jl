# DSandALGO with Julia
Learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Julia

### The Project
This project is based on assignments for a course in *'Algorithms and Data
structures'* given at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** in Stockholm.

All the Data Structures and Algorithms will be implemented in **Julia**.
Code will be mostly written in ***VSCode*** and run on
***Julia 1.8.0***.
Quick-fixes and editing will however, most definitely be done in **Vim**.

Some scripts were executed from the **REPL terminal** while others (e.g.
when using DataFrames, performing benchmarks and producing Plots) were executed
from **Jupyter Notebook**. The **Pluto Notebook** will be used to create interactive notebooks.  


### Learning ''by doing'' the whole shabang; 
* Version control using Git and GitHub,
* Data Structures, 
* Algorithms, 
* Julia, 
* Pluto, 
* Jupyter
* RPN
* LaTeX...
